### Heyo!ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working on gaining more knowledge in the computer language, with the purpose of transitioning into the world of EV's.
My passions are fast cars and fast PEV's(personal electric vehicles).
Fun fact, I used to hate the idea of owning an EV, until I opened my mind and got an s-skateboard, and that has led me down this rabbit hole I found myself in today, learning coding! Ask me about it and I'll talk with you all day! If you want in, lmk!
Cheers!!
